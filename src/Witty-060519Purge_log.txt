060519Purge:
==================
The objective is to remove everything except the core rebuilt functionality of dev and user mode displaying an image and its dimViewers, in preparation for reviewing and ebuilding everything piece by piece.
There was a lot of garbage and fluff in the last working version that has to go away and be improved.
We're removing everything except the UIController aliases to HTML UI Elements in as far as they're probably in use somewhere, the functions that expose the UI elements, and function calls in the modules to get the HTML UI Elements. Removed code can be retrieved from scripts_06.05.19B.js. Removed code is listed below.

Now I have the same problem as before this exercise...can't get the Appdata values to persist. The answer lies in callbacks but I don't understand them!


UIController private
-------------------
Removed:
ccpPropStrings
toggleCheckbox
testme
IIFE (open CCP by default)

Kept:
dimViewers
toolButtons
dynamicRegions
staticRegions
ccpUserInput
ccpBuildTag

UIController public
-------------------
Removed:
setDimAlerts
ccpToggle
initCCP
showElementOnInput
flashAppMessage

Kept:
getDimViewerIDs
getToolButtonIDs
getDynamicRegionIDs
getStaticRegionIDs
getCcpUserInputIDs
getCcpBuildTagIDs
initUI
writeDimViewers
	ISSUES: Evaluate use of Math.round
writeFilenameToUI
removeCurImg

clipboardController private
--------------------------
Removed:
dimViewers (getDimViewerIDs)
ccpPropStrings (getCcpPropStringsIDs)
ccpBuildTag (getCcpBuildTagIDs)
ClipboardOutput

Kept:
dynamicRegions (getDynamicRegionIDs)
staticRegions (getStaticRegionIDs)
toolButtons (getToolButtonIDs)
ccpUserInput (getCcpUserInputIDs)


clipboardController public
	ISSUES: clipboardController => cbController
--------------------------
clipboardControllerTest
ccpIfNoUserInput
ccpGetCBImgHTML
ccpGetCBTdHTML
ccpGetCBTableHTML
ccpGetCBImgDisplayCSS
ccpGetCBImgLPhonesCSS
ccpGetCBImgSPhonesCSS

appController private
--------------------------
Removed:
ccpPropStrings (getCcpPropStringsIDs)
ccpBuildTag (getCcpBuildTagIDs)
validateInteger
errorHandler
	ISSUES: evaluate the UICOntroller.accessAppdata call. This can be removed since all this does is display errorMessages based on error codes passed to it.
elementIDToAppDataProp
showAppMessage
doit






Kept:
dimViewers
dynamicRegions
staticRegions
toolButtons
ccpUserInput
setupEventListeners
handleUserAction
getAppObj => was getCurImgDimensions
	ISSUES: This has to be reinitialized every time there's a user action, or else the previous values will persist!
removeCurImg
handleFileSelect
calcViewerDimensions =>calcImgViewerSize
	ISSUES: evaluate why getAspectRatio is called from here, since Appobj.aspect is provided.
		DONE: Fixed, uses Appobj.aspect now.
		evaluate the use of Math.round instead of parseInt, which is used elsewhere.
		I'm going to keep an eye on this and leave it as is for now.
doContainerHeights => adjustImgContainers
	ISSUES: move to UIController since it directly manipulates the DOM
	CHANGED:Moved to UIController
		
getAspectRatio
intToPx
NEW:
handleCustomWidth
validateInteger





appController public
--------------------------
initDev
