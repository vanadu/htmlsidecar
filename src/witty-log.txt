IN PROGRESS: Clean up structure based on flowchart.

WHat I'm seeing in the Jonas project is that appController only has one public function... init. Everything else is called from that, and all the public functions are in UIController and budgetController.

So let's recap:

appController.init:
	-starts app
	-sets imgViewer to default H and W
	-displays dropArea
	-sets display toolsContainer to none
	-calls setupEventListeners
	-determines if app is in dev mode and if so, initializes Appdata for dev mode. We can ignore that for now.
	-makes sure the CCP is closed, and runs refreshAppUI to populate the dimViewers with 'no image'. 
	-runs setupEventHandlers to wait for user input. 

UIController.handleFileSelect
	-initiated by drop event
	-get the blob
	-assign the blob's filename to a variable
	-hide the drop area
	-initialize and populate Appobj with image data. The only thing that needs to be gotten here, though, is curImg. The rest - imgViewer, imgVieweport and appContainer are constants that are queried from the CSS dimensions. Maybe Appdata should be initialized and passed from appInit. 
	-set timeout of 250ms while the blob loads.
	-run onload function to ensure the blob has loaded. THis is probably redundant with the preceding instruction. Once the image has loaded:
		-hide the dropArea
		-show toolsContainer
		-show curImg
		-set Appobj.currentimg - 
		-run UIController.getAppData to get Appdata properties
		-run clipboardController.evalViewerSize to resize the image containers based on Appdata
	Once the above is complete:
	-run writeImgToDOM with the callback to create the image to the DOM based on the Appdata.
	
	This is totally convoluted!

TODO: Implement Mobile Swap
----------------------------
When button is not highlighted, show CCP on clipboard icon click.
When button is highlighted, show Swap Control Panel (SCP) on clipboard click.
When button is clicked, save current image data, and show mobile drop area. When mobile image is loded, put data in Appdatamob. Arrows are displayed to left and right of dim viewers to allow switching back and forth from desktop to mobile image. 



TODO: pull handleUserAction out to separate function
TODO: Implement Td and table copy to clipboard buttons.
TODO: FIX- When you focus on td or table input, the CSS CLipboard buttons appear in the img tag section. They should only  appear if the focus is in the img class input.
TODO: FIX - Delay after clicking a copy-to-clipboard button is too long.
TODO: FEATURE - Image swap. THIS NEEDS TO BE HASHED OUT!
TODO: FEATURE - Make bgcolor add the hash if it's not in the value
TODO: FIX, when imgNW is greater than imgW the imgNW size flashes before resizing to the viewer size. This is probably because of the settimeout, which might not be necesssary if the onload function is running.
TODO: BEHAVIOR - THe CCP should store all the currently selected options and restore them whenever the ccp is opened. This needs to be revisited. viewerW should persist for the session. imgW and imgH should persist for the current image. I'm not sure how long the CCP options should persist.
TODO: BEHAVIOR - Assign keyboard  shortcuts
TODO: Assign  tab order


As of 01.01.19
===============

DONE: Rename 'controller' to appController
DONE: Shorten the clipboard function names and make them more descriptive and extensible:
