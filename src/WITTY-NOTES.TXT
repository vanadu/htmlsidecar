BIG TODO!
TODO: Deal with the indents and embedded tag issue.


Img is included as a child of td in the maketablenode function. Should it not only be passed as a child of td? Otherwise, how can the Td.Bgimage innerhtml be passed to the doIndent?





For later:
TODO: The CSS output will need to be revisited. You'd never need to output the width AND height in CSS for tables and for td it probably has no effect for height. That means...ugh.
TODO: It's bad that writeClipboard is called even when that clipboard isn't being output. ccpMakeTdTag calls ccpMakeImgTag which calls writeClipboard -- that makes no sense.
