BIG TODO!
All tables must have cellspacing border and cellpadding attributes!
Is including the id in the make element functions necessary?
Need to include a way to clear all the CB options since they now persist until a new image is added, I think. Review this.
Must add color picker to toolbar!



TD functions:
There are three variants.
1) Basic build TD
	a	creates the td element
	adds valign attribute which is common to all variants -- but that could change if I add options...we'll include it for now to keep it DRY
	
2) User-defined variants
	a 	adds class, align, bgcolor and includes img tag
	
3) Stig variants
	adds width, height, background
	includes innerhtml with vml
	
I'm starting to thing it might be better to just include all the attributes in one object and then retrieve them as needed with ES6 arguments. That would look like getSwapObject in the arnie project. I was on the right track with that earlier -- all the element attributes in one big object that can be called as required.


In doClipboard:

if TD button click:
	if Stig checkmark checked
		function: makeStigTdTag
			call the needed attributes
			innerHTML included in function
			write to clipboard
	else
		function: makeUserDefinedTdTag
			call the needed attributes
			include img tag
			write to clipboard
			
		
if TABLE button click:
	if !Wrapper table
		function: makeTableTag
			call the needed attributes
			include the user-defined version of the tag, which should also include the img tag
			
	else
		function:
