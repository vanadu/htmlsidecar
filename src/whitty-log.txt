TODO: Rename exiting CCP icons, implement TD and Table CCP icons
TODO: FIX - FInd and display the notification area
TODO: FIX- When you focus on td or table input, the CSS CLipboard buttons appear in the img tag section. They should only  appear if the focus is in the img class input.
TODO: FIX - Delay after clicking a copy-to-clipboard button is too long.
TODO: FEATURE - Image swap. THIS NEEDS TO BE HASHED OUT!
TODO: FEATURE - Make bgcolor add the hash if it's not in the value
TODO: FIX, when imgNW is greater than imgW the imgNW size flashes before resizing to the viewer size. This is probably because of the settimeout, which might not be necesssary if the onload function is running.
TODO: BEHAVIOR - THe CCP should store all the currently selected options and restore them whenever the ccp is opened. This needs to be revisited. viewerW should persist for the session. imgW and imgH should persist for the current image. I'm not sure how long the CCP options should persist.
TODO: BEHAVIOR - Assign keyboard  shortcuts
TODO: Assign  tab order

DONE: FIXED - When you focus on td or table input, the CSS CLipboard buttons appear in the img tag section. They should only  appear if the focus is in the img class input.
