TODO: Clean up structure based on flowchart.
	-pull handleUserAction out to separate function
	-abbreviate the clipboard output functions, the names are too long.
	-determine what constitutes the Model in this app. The model represents the data and does nothing else. So, the data here is just the clipboard output, that is, the HTML tags themselves. 
	



TODO: Implement Mobile Swap
----------------------------
When button is not highlighted, show CCP on clipboard icon click.
When button is highlighted, show Swap Control Panel (SCP) on clipboard click.
When button is clicked, save current image data, and show mobile drop area. When mobile image is loded, put data in Appdatamob. Arrows are displayed to left and right of dim viewers to allow switching back and forth from desktop to mobile image. 




TODO: Implement Td and table copy to clipboard buttons.
TODO: FIX- When you focus on td or table input, the CSS CLipboard buttons appear in the img tag section. They should only  appear if the focus is in the img class input.
TODO: FIX - Delay after clicking a copy-to-clipboard button is too long.
TODO: FEATURE - Image swap. THIS NEEDS TO BE HASHED OUT!
TODO: FEATURE - Make bgcolor add the hash if it's not in the value
TODO: FIX, when imgNW is greater than imgW the imgNW size flashes before resizing to the viewer size. This is probably because of the settimeout, which might not be necesssary if the onload function is running.
TODO: BEHAVIOR - THe CCP should store all the currently selected options and restore them whenever the ccp is opened. This needs to be revisited. viewerW should persist for the session. imgW and imgH should persist for the current image. I'm not sure how long the CCP options should persist.
TODO: BEHAVIOR - Assign keyboard  shortcuts
TODO: Assign  tab order
