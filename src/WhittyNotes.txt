Swap img function
==================
Be able to:

We only need desktop and mobile image data to build the swap TD that outputs HTML. 

Select option to save image values as Desktop
Select option to save Values as Mbile
Show user which sizes are selected

Output TD. Period -- the classes defined in the HTML img and span are default definitions found in the media query for the desktop size.

Probably the best place is in the toolbuttons upper left, which should then display a new CCP - a SCP or Swap Control Panel

TODO in Windows:
Create buttons for missing td and table CSS CB output.
